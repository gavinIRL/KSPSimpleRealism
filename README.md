# KSPSimpleRealism (description incomplete)
Collection of lightweight patches for Kerbal Space Program to add semi-realism* with minimal requirements
NOTE: THIS MOD IS NOT CURRENTLY FUNCTIONAL AND IS WIP

## Credit
All of the config files I have created are heavily inspired by Realism Overhaul and RP-0/RP-1. I have included a description in the config files if some small sections have been copied from Realism Overhaul however there are very few direct copies, the overwhelming majority of the content in the config files has been created by me.
The source code is taken entirely from RP-0 and all credit goes to the team of contributors there. I have neutered RP-0 through editing a small number of lines of code but mostly through the config files where possible. A more detailed description of changes to the source code will be included ASAP.

## Overview
Will add soon!
## Requirements
Will add soon!
## Balancing and Deviations from Realistic Values

## To-do List / Future Changes and Plans
