// Gav Electric Propulsion


// The idea is that the TWR should be punitive enough that it 
// A) Certainly doesn't allow landings (unless we're talking phobos)
// B) Doesn't really allow mercury orbital insertions direct from Earth (with some burning pre-SOI it's very possible)
// C) But at the same time doesn't take hours for the burn to happen (max TWR of any engine is 0.331 @ 4000 ISP with Xenon)

// So for reference at the top-end 2060 xenon tech level, with sufficient 2060 solar panels for mean Mercury orbit
// On a craft with 2060 orbital science, 2060 pluto antenna, sufficient deep space probe core avionics and fuel tank for 20000 m/s
// A thruster thruster 0.625m diameter would take 18hrs to burn through the fuel i.e. mean effective acceleration of 0.3m/s^2
// With a 1.25m part it would take 12hrs for a mean effective acceleration of 0.45m/s^2
// So 4x thrust (tweakscale mass and thrust are power2) results in effective 1.5x increase in acceleration
// In other words, ridiculous performance vs real-life but interesting enough for a game like KSP
// While still maintaining the real-world disadvantage of electrical propusion

// Allowing 10% minimal throttle which is unrealistic and diverges from RO's 50%...
// ...but convenient with variable power sources (variation in solar panel output Earth vs Mercury)

// Finally the power requirements are so that using solar panel at mean Mercury orbit would require:
// 	0.7-2.7*engine mass in solar panels for xenon
// 	2.6-7.5*engine mass in solar panels for argon
// 	0.3-0.6*engine mass in solar panels for lithium

// Balancing of the 3 propellants is as follows:
// Xenon has highest TWR, lowest ISP, lowest EC/kN, highest fuel density
// Argon has above average TWR and ISP, highest EC/kN, average fuel density
// Lithium has tiny TWR, very high ISP, above average EC/kN, very low fuel density
// Balanced to pay heavy price in versatility (power generation/storage or TWR) for that extra ISP
// The types of thruster don't really follow real life, the starting balance point was density
// Xenon and Argon are positioned about right relative to each other 
// But Lithium MPDT is opposite to real-life in most areas relative to Argon Hall-effect (TWR,EC/s,ISP)

// Note that patches go late to avoid the NFP tweaking patch
