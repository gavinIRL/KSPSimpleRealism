// GavCapacitor

// Tricky part to proceduralise due to how the DischargeCapacitor Module works
// The discharge rate and maximum charge are independent of...the actual max held charge
// Therefore the max discharge rate is set to 1000 as it seems a reasonable number
// The minimum% value is made 5% to not have ridiculous limits on smaller capacitors
// Charge rate of 5 should deter rapid consecutive burns with electric engines
// And the maximum charge value is made astronomical so that the part doesn't stop recharging early
// However this means that it doesn't stop recharging at all sadly, manual intervention required
// Compared to battery it is half the density for the same charge i.e. 2x power density
// Much less than stock NFE (x8) but more than RO (x1)
// In essence, not particularly realistic but a viable interesting option with drawbacks
// !!! Note for future reference that setting the charge rate to 0 is how to make a single-use battery
