// PARTS TO REMOVE //
// If you're wondering why I did it this way it's because I removed parts gradually as I modified things
// And therefore I ended up with this giant ugly list so thought I might as well finish it
// A much better implementation would be the RP0/RO way of tagging the part and moving parts elsewhere
// However this still loads the part model which I don't want
// However as a backup at the bottom I do indeed tag any parts which are outside the list of parts I want
// And move them to another category similar to RP-0/RO
