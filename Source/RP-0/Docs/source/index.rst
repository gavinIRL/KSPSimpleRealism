Realistic Progression One (RP-1)
================================

Welcome!
--------

Realistic Progression One (RP-1) is a career mode addon for 
the `Realism Overhaul`_ suite of mods for `Kerbal Space Program`_.

RP-1 is the quasi-successor to RP-0. There have been many changes
from RP-0 to RP-1 and the game plays much differently. It was decided
that it deserved a new name, and RP-1 was born. Where RP-0 called
itself the "lightweight career add-on", RP-1 is most definitely not.
It offers a completely different experience from most anything
else that is available for `Kerbal Space Program`_.

What is New?
------------

A lot has changed from RP-0 and this is a concise list of some of the
biggest changes. The first thing to understand is that RP-1 is a very different
experience from RP-0. This is the reason we decided on the name change, it is
basically the equivalent of a sequel. There are new game mechanics that you will have
to learn all over again, so please RTFM and learn what is new. Click on each link to
go to the corresponding page that has much more detail on each feature.
