Includes code from magico13 from the mod project FlightSchool -- thanks so much!

Includes code and assets from the mod KerbalConstructionTime. Relicensed as CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0 by permission from Magico13 and Linuxgurugamer.

Note: There is an intention to more significantly alter the code in future to further strip it down. Nevertheless, all of the credit for the source code should go to the RP-0 contributors (and not me as all I've really done is just create a bunch of config files).
